"Similar to BTE, OSM_ has the goal to map all of the world. While we are "
"working on our Minecraft world, we can contribute to the OSM project and "
"help them to achieve their goal. By editing the OSM database you not only"
" make your own build easier but at the same time you can help identify "
"infrastructure that might be crucial in future humanitarian work. This "
"applies especially if you are working in a developing country where maps "
"are hard to come by. OSM maps are also used by different mapping sevices "
"such as Apple maps."

"You must create an account in OSM_ to be able to edit the maps. For this "
"you only need an email address. Click on **Edit** at the top of the "
"screen and then **register**. After the registration is done you will get"
" into the Edit-mode. You will be presented with a short (15 min) tutorial"
" that will teach you the basics of OSM_. Please use the hashtag **#BTE** "
"in your editing comments."

"In remote areas of the world sometimes the satellite images are either "
"not as good as you wish, or they do not align to the elements that have "
"already been placed in OSM_. In the “edit” mode of OSM_ you will find a "
"background settings icon on the right of the map. Here you can choose "
"between different satellite and other map types. Sometimes features of "
"buildings are more visible on one of the other images. If there are "
"already some structures mapped in your OSM_ region, but the underlying "
"satellite image does not align correctly to these structures you have to "
"move the satellite image. Go to the **background setting** to find "
"**Adjust imagery offset** at the bottom. Use the arrows to move the "
"satellite image to align to the pre-generated elements."

"It can take some time until the changes you made in OSM_ are registered "
"in the database. After **30 - 60 min** you should be able to regenerate "
"the part of the Minecraft world you edited to see the changes. Select the"
" area you edited in OSM_ using the WorldEdit ``//wand``. There is a bug "
"that replaces roads with single stone brick lines therefore you should "
"make sure not to select roads if possible. Then use the ``//regen`` "
"command to regenerate the edited terrain."
