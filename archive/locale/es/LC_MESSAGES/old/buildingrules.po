"There are however stretched locations. Due to the fact that the world is "
"not flat, some locations in the world will be stretched a bit. This is a "
"math problem that has been worked on for hundreds of years, and we knew "
"this going in. This means that in some places, the ratio might be 1:1.25 "
"or even higher, meaning the buildings and distances will be larger "
"compared to other locations in the world. You will have to research this "
"at your location, and build accordingly. You will also have to increase "
"the height of your building by the ratio of the location, to make sure "
"the building does not look stretched. A safe way to do it, is to add "
"everything to the OpenStreetMap, as this will place the buildings exactly"
