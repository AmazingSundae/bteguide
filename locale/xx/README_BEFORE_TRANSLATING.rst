Uhh... If you're reading this you're doing things wrong. No matter, we can fix this.

Y'know where you were copying in the commands? Saw the "xx" parts? Change that to your language code as seen in this table. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes

Do ``git checkout master`` and re-run those commands with the right language code, and you should be good to go! If you have any more questions, DM ``EzraEn#4291``.
